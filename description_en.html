		Hello!<br>
		<br>
		I am Luigi Chiricosta!<br>
		I am a bioinformaticist graduated at the <a href="http://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/Bioinformatics/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"><i>Bioinformatics</i> course</a> of the <b>Alma Mater Studiorum</b> in Bologna.<br><br>
		I obtained my second level master's degree with a mark of 110/110 in the 2017.<br>
		My thesis project was entitled <a href="https://github.com/LuigiChiricosta/Detecting-cancer-causing-genes-and-variants-in-Colon-Adenocarcinoma/blob/master/Detecting%20cancer%20causing%20genes%20and%20variants%20in%20Colon%20Adenocarcinoma%20(Presentation)%20-%20Luigi%20Chiricosta.pdf"><b><i>Detecting cancer causing genes and variants in Colon Adenocarcinoma</i></b></a>.<br><br>
		I am intrigued by the relationship among genotype and phenotype in problems pertinent complex systems.<br>
		I am very thrilled to the scientific research, in particular about <i>Artificial intelligence</i> and <i>Machine learning</i> applied to the human beings in medical area but even about the interaction <i>human being - robot</i>.<br>
		<br>
		I got the certification in English language as B2 level, required to attempt the Master course.<br>
		<br>
		My background is in <i>Computer Science</i>.
		I am graduated with the highest honours at the University in Messina in the 2013/2014 accademic year in the department of <i>Mathematics and Computer Science</i>.<br>
		During the Bachelor's Degree I strengthened skills about software design on a lot of platforms like C++, Java, Python, XML, HTML, SQL, HSQL, PHP, JavaScript, CSS enhanced by means of the internship taked place in Milan using both client-oriented and server-oriented technologies on Windows, Linux and Android systems.<br>
		For pleasure, the thesis project entitled <b>L'uomo, i robot e l'intelligenza artificiale</b> discussed not only about software but even about hardware, in which I specialized by myself.<br>
		In particular, I worked on Arduino board that I used to allow an easy linkage among hardware and software side, among Arduino, Android and Java (used even for a the realisation of a server on Windows).<br>

		Bye!<br>
