			Hello!<br>
			<br>
			My name is Luigi Chiricosta,<br><br>
			I have a fellow as researcher by <a href="https://www.irccsme.it/neurolesi/" target="_blank">IRCCS Centro Neurolesi <i>"Bonino-Pulejo"</i></a> in Messina.<br>
			I am involved in diagnosis and development of bioinformatics pipeline for Next-Generation Sequencing platform about neurodegenerative diseases.<br><br>			
			I was a scholarship holder by Padua University.<br>
			I was involved in the study of neurodevelopment disorders and autism spectrum.<br>
			To be precise, I am focused on the bioinformatic side since I am graduated on <a href="http://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/Bioinformatics/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"><i>Bioinformatics</i></a> in Bologna, at the <b>Alma Mater Studiorum</b>.<br><br>
			I obtained my Master's degree with a mark of 110/110 in 2017.<br>
			My graduate thesis project is titled <a href="https://github.com/LuigiChiricosta/Detecting-cancer-causing-genes-and-variants-in-Colon-Adenocarcinoma/blob/master/Detecting%20cancer%20causing%20genes%20and%20variants%20in%20Colon%20Adenocarcinoma.pdf" target="_blank"><b><i>Detecting cancer causing genes and variants in Colon Adenocarcinoma</i></b></a>.<br><br>
			I have a significant interest in scientific research, specifically progress made with the advancement of<br>
			<i>artificial intelligence</i>, <i>machine learning</i>, <i>robotics</i> and their application to the medical fields.<br>
			<br>
			My English level is B2, certified as this was required to study my Master degree.<br>
			<br>
			My background is in <i>Computer Science</i>,<br>
			which I graduated with the highest honours at the University of Messina in 2014,<br>
			department of <i>Mathematics and Computer Science</i>.<br>
			During my Bachelor's Degree course I strengthened my skills about on software design on several platforms which include C++, Java, Python, XML, HTML, SQL, HSQL, PHP, JavaScript, CSS.<br>
			These are enhanced by an internship taken in Milan using both client and server-oriented technologies on Windows, Linux and Android systems.<br>
			As I am passionate about it, my thesis project titled <a href="https://github.com/LuigiChiricosta/L-uomo-i-robot-e-l-intelligenza-artificiale/blob/master/L'uomo%2C%20i%20robot%20e%20l'intelligenza%20atificiale.pdf" target="_blank"><b><i>L'uomo, i robot e l'intelligenza artificiale</i></b></a> not only is about software but I have spoken about hardware, in which I specialised by myself.<br>
			I worked on an Arduino board that I used to allow an easy linkage between hardware and software side, with Arduino, Android and Java (used also to create a server).<br>
			<br>
			In addition to this, I am a guitar player graduated at the level 6 Yamaha course with maximum marks.
			<br><br>
			Thanks for stopping by and feel free to contact me at my e-mail address if you would like to work with me!<br><br>
			Bye!<br>
